Assignment Description
----------------------
- This is a team project.
- The goal is to create a game that takes place inside a building, which will be represented as a grid of 81 squares. 
- Every square represents a possible position for different entities in the game (player's avatar, enemies, power-ups), 
with the exception of 9 special squares, which represent rooms, and are equally distributed on the grid.
